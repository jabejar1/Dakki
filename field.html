    <h3>Looking at the field</h3>
    <ul>
        <aside><img src="field.jpeg" alt="field"></aside>
        <li>1.<strong>Main Monster Zones</strong></li>-This is where monsters are summoned, 
        restricting a duelist to 5 monsters normally, unless a monster is special summoned from the extra deck.
        <li>2.<strong>Spell/Trap zones</strong></li>- This is where the spell and traps are played, or placed if being set face down for future use.
        <li>3.<strong>Deck zone</strong></li>- This is where a player sets their deck, your opponent has one on his side of the field as well!
        <li>4.<strong>Graveyard</strong></li>- whenever a monster is destroyed or a spell/trap effect is used, they go to the graveyard, not able to be used unless resurrected or brought back.
        <li>5.<strong>Banish pile</strong></li>- whenever a monster is banished, it is a lot harder to bring back, not always permanent but a lot harder to bring back!
        <li>6.<strong>Field Spell zone</strong></li>- whenever a player plays a field spell, it goes here! Each player can control their own field spell, and grants powetful effects.
        <li>7.<strong>Extra Deck zone</strong></li>- A player's extra deck monsters go here to be summoned during a game!
        <li>8.<strong>Pendulum zones</strong></li>- This is where players set their pendulum scales! So a player cannot use their leftmost or rightmost zones for spells or traps if they plan to pendulum summon
        <li>9.<strong>Extra Monster Zones</strong></li>- Link monsters, as well as pendulum monsters brought from the extra deck go here! Other extra deck monsters are not restricted like this!
