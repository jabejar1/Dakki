<h3>Card Types</h3>
      
           <p><strong>Monsters</strong> are characterized by a beige border and are your main weapons, utilizing them to attack your opponent and reduce their lifepoint to 0!
            They can be powerhouses that dominate the field, or have very useful effects that can be utilized
            to bring out other monsters, add other cards to hands or even stop your opponent from advancing their plays!
            </p>
        <p><strong>Spells</strong>are characterized by a light green border and offer a large amount of versatility, being able to
             be played immediately, or be saved for use later! Some can even be used on your opponent's turn, and others stay on the field even after being used, 
             allowing them to be used for future turns! From searching your deck for crucial cards, to boosting attack, these help you to achieve victory!
            </p>
        <p><strong>Traps</strong> are characterized by a light purple border must first be set before being activated, so they can be a little slower,
            but because of this, they often have far more powerful effecs which can help turn the tides of battle!
            From destroying all monsters during battle, to negating effects, or even banishing your opponent's field, there are many possibilities!
